      question: "What are Greencoin carbon credits and how do they work?",
      answer: "Carbon credits represent one metric ton of COâ‚‚ equivalent that has been removed from the atmosphere or prevented from being emitted. When farmers adopt climate-smart practices like agroforestry or no-till farming, they increase carbon storage in soil and biomass. These verified carbon reductions can be converted into tradeable Greencoin Token credits that companies purchase to offset their emissions. Each credit you generate represents real environmental impact and provides additional income for sustainable farming practices."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I start earning GreenCoins?",
      answer: "Simply download our mobile app, register your farm, and begin implementing climate-smart practices. Our satellite monitoring system will automatically detect your sustainable activities and reward you with GreenCoins."

      question: "How is my data verified?",
      answer: "GreenCoin verifies your data through a multi-step process. First, eco-friendly farming data is collected via sensors, images, or GPS. Then, AI and satellite tools analyze your carbon-reducing activities. In some cases, field officers visit for on-ground verification. Once confirmed, your data is stored securely on the blockchain. Verified actions are converted into carbon credits, and you earn GreenCoin tokens as rewards. This ensures fairness, accuracy, and transparency across the platform."

        <div>
          <p style={{ margin: 0, lineHeight: 1.6, color: "var(--secondary)" }}>
            The payment timeline depends on verification requirements:<br /><br />
            <strong>Initial Setup:</strong> 4-6 weeks for registration and baseline measurements<br />
            <strong>First Payment:</strong> 6-12 months after implementation (varies by practice)<br />
            <strong>Ongoing Payments:</strong> Annual payments after verification<br />
            <strong>Marketplace Sales:</strong> 2-14 days after listing credits for sale<br /><br />
            Fast-growing practices like cover crops can generate credits within 6 months, while tree-based systems may take 12-18 months for first payments but offer higher long-term returns.
