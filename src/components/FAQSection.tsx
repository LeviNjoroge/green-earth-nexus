      question: "How do I start earning GreenCoins?",
      answer: "Simply download our mobile app, register your farm, and begin implementing climate-smart practices. Our satellite monitoring system will automatically detect your sustainable activities and reward you with GreenCoins."
    },
    {
      question: "What qualifies as climate-smart farming?",
      answer: "We recognize various sustainable practices including cover cropping, agroforestry, reduced tillage, rotational grazing, organic farming, water conservation, soil carbon sequestration, and renewable energy use on farms."
    },
    {
      question: "How is my data verified?",
      answer: "We use a combination of satellite imagery, AI analysis, and IoT sensors to verify farming practices. This creates an immutable record on the blockchain, ensuring transparent and accurate reward distribution."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use GreenCoins like regular money?",
      answer: "Yes! GreenCoins can be exchanged for local currency, used to purchase farming supplies, or traded on supported exchanges. We're building partnerships with agricultural suppliers to accept GreenCoins directly."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need internet to use the platform?",
      answer: "No. Our offline-first mobile wallet syncs automatically when connectivity is available. You can continue earning and accessing your balance even in remote areas without consistent internet access."
    },
    {
      question: "How much can I earn with GreenCoins?",
      answer: "Earnings depend on your farm size, practices implemented, and environmental impact. Early farmers in our pilot program have earned between $200-$2000 per year, with potential for higher rewards as the platform scales."
    },
    {
      question: "Is GreenCoin secure and legitimate?",
      answer: "Absolutely. Built on the Internet Computer Protocol, all transactions are recorded on-chain with cryptographic security. We're partnered with recognized climate organizations and follow international environmental standards."
    },
    {
      question: "What farming data do you collect?",
      answer: "We only collect data necessary for verification: satellite images of your land, farming practice timestamps, and environmental impact metrics. All data is encrypted and you maintain full ownership and control."
